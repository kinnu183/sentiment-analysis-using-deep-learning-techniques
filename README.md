## sentiment-analysis-using-deep-learning-techniques
The main objective is to assess different deep learning techniques used for sentiment analysis. The fundamental idea behind this work is to use PyTorch to develop convolution neural networks to train and classify movie review sentiment classes. The sentiment of new movies may be predicted using this CNN model. I also developed the FastText model and compared both CNN and FastText models.

## Manifest
1) **CNN_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb** - Contains the core logic of CNN model for sentiment analysis

2) **FastText_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb** - Contains the core logic of FastText model for sentiment analysis

I have also uploaded the python files. The code can be executed in both Jupyter notebook as well as Google Colab


## References
I have taken the help of the following GitHub repository to understand and implement this logic -
